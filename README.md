# Face Recognition with ColorFeret and LFW Datasets using different VGG architectures and Transfer Learning/Finetuning
This repository is very disorganized and of a very old project that I and one other student collaborator worked on 2 years back without both of us having proper knowledge of
**Git**
. You can look through all the branches but I admit that it's super messy now with alls sorts of 
***protobuf***
and 
***prototxt***
files that we used for our project back then. It also contains several 
***bash***
scripts for preprocessing, training, validation and testing, and also several 
***python*** 
scripts for interfacing i.e. doing training and validation. We were absolutely raw and new into both 
**Deep Learning**
and 
**Caffe** 
back then.
